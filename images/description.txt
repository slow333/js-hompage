 If you get stuck, you can compare your version of the code to ours, to see what it is meant to look like â€” see it live, and see the source code.
 If you were improving this code, you might want to loop through a list of items to display, fetching and decoding each one, and then loop through the results inside Promise.all(), running a different function to display each one depending on what the type of code was. This would make it work for any number of items, not just three.

Also, you could determine what the type of file is being fetched without needing an explicit type property. You could, for example, check the Content-Type HTTP header of the response in each case using response.headers.get("content-type"), and then react accordingly.
